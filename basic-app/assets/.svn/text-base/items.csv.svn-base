Today| I realized that for every two pieces| I always find one good quality straight beam. Put this with some stones and I might have a workable tool for mining.12,frame,Frame,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,It may not look like much progress| but I think I can make a general-purpose frame out of a few beams. This| along with some well shaped stones| can put me on the right path again.13,handle,Handle,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,With a bit more effort| I can find one beam that is just right to be a handle for some tools.PPWith the right equipment| I think I might be able to chop down some of the larger trees instead of snapping off branches like I do now| or do some mining with a pickaxe in the next valley over.PPMaybe I can even attach a rock to one and make a hammer. I know| that sounds a little crazy| it's been a long day.14,workbench,Workbench,wood,Woodworking,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,My first large woodworking project is complete today. My new workbench should let me build larger and higher quality items.PPI saw a loom in a store downtown yesterday| made mostly from beams of wood. I think there was a glint of metal| I couldn't tell much with the window glare| and I was too shy to go in and ask. Hopefully I can learn to make my own someday.15,stone_furnace,Stone Furnace,stone,Masonry,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,It has been cold recently| I can see my breath some evenings. At night| I just sit and stare at the constellations| recalling what I was taught and making some of my own.PP But I am making a lot of progress| I built a furnace today. It's actually just a pile of rocks| but I think it will work for what I need.16,stone_pick,Stone Pick,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Guided by the beam| I found some stones that are straight and pointed enough to pick at the soil.PPLast night I dreamt again that I was flying. Clouds sailed by| and I could smell the sharp tang of the sea.17,stone_pickaxe,Stone Pickaxe,stone,Masonry,pickup|copper_ore,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I smoothed out the pick and fit it on a handle earlier| and now I have a real tool for mining and exploring. The copper ore has seemed the loosest mineral| I will start with that first and follow the patterns I learned about stonework.18,stone_wedge,Stone Wedge,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,With a little bit of sanding| I have sharpened the edge of some stones into a wedge shape| and hollowed out a hole in the bottom for a handle.19,stone_axe,Stone Axe,stone,Masonry,pickup|wood,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,The slice of the wedge is enough to make a deep bite into trees| and with the handle| I can swing and gather wood twice as fast as before.20,thread,Thread,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,A few local farmers have been letting me pick up leftover wool from their herds. With a little work| I have managed to make it useable as some thread. My clothes are getting a bit thin after my travels| and I might be able to repair them now. Maybe even make new clothes eventually.21,felt,Felt,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Sometimes it pays off to experiment. Water and wool| never thought that was how felt was made. It's a bit misshapen right now| need to stretch and rework it a bit. Nothing ever turns out right the first time for me| but I keep trying.22,stone_hammer,Stone Hammer,stone,Masonry,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I was right! A little bit shaky| but the thread should hold the stone in place in my new hammer. I think it will be strong enough for some metalwork| if I can find enough copper to be productive.23,crate,Crate,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Crate24,boat,Boat,wood,Woodworking,vehicle,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Boat25,barrel,Barrel,wood,Woodworking,pickup|water,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Barrel26,loom,Loom,wool,Tailoring,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Loom27,glass,Glass,sand,Glassblowing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Glass28,bottle,Bottle,sand,Glassblowing,pickup|water,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Bottle29,hourglass,Hourglass,sand,Glassblowing,refresh,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Hourglass30,dust,Dust,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Phew! That hammer has proven handy lately. Busting up a few odd-shaped and otherwise worthless rocks into dust might not be terribly useful| but it helps burn off some of my anger. Although I am now covered in fine powder and need to wash up and sand off.31,pulp,Pulp,wood,Scribing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Another use for the hammer. I can pound wood into a pulp when soaked it in water first| then smooth it and shape it however I want. Although it is still rather damp.PPThis journal is one of the few pieces of my old life I could keep| and it feels like I am close to making another on my own.32,paper,Paper,wood,Scribing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,A quick spot of drying on top of the furnace| and the thin sheets of pulp are now crude pieces of paper.

If I can frame it right| there's probably something useful to be made from this plate.48,copper_pick,Copper Pick,metal,Metallurgy - Basic,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,The wooden template still worked| I was able to make a copper pick out of bars instead of stone.

It turned out ... OK. I'm sure I'll be getting a lot of practice now| reworking all my old copper designs. It is definitely stronger| and I think I'll need to upgrade my tools to make any real progress.PPI feel like a new phase of my life is beginning| and I'm making my dreams a reality.
