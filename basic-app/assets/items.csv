I wake up from every noise I hear outside my tent. I never realized the quiet wilderness could be so loud.PPI have been picking up a lot of wood recently. Today| I realized that for every two pieces| I always find one good quality straight beam. Put this with some stones and I might have a workable tool for mining.12,frame,Frame,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,It may not look like much progress| but I put some beams together| kind of like a picture frame. This| along with some well shaped stones| can put me on the right path again.PPI've been keeping to myself| but my clothes don't look too outlandish| so I might venture into the local village soon.13,handle,Handle,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,With the right handle for some tools| I think I might be able to chop down some of the larger trees instead of snapping off branches like I do now| or do some mining with a pickaxe in the next valley over.PPMaybe I can even attach a rock to one and make a hammer. I know| that sounds a little crazy| it's been a long day.14,workbench,Workbench,wood,Woodworking,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,My first large woodworking project is complete today. My new workbench should let me build larger and higher quality items.PPI saw a loom in a house in town yesterday| made mostly from beams of wood. I think there was a glint of metal| I couldn't tell much with the window glare| and I was too scared to go in and ask. Hopefully I can learn to make my own someday.15,stone_furnace,Stone Furnace,stone,Masonry,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,It has been cold recently| I can see my breath some evenings. At night| I just sit and stare at the constellations| trying to recall what I was taught and making some of my own.PPBut I am making a lot of progress| I built a furnace today. It's actually just a pile of rocks where I can burn some wood| but I think it will work for what I need.PPI've been able to eat mostly what I find here in the wilderness| luckily there is an abandoned orchard nearby| and with this furnace I might once again have some hot meals.16,stone_pick,Stone Pick,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Guided by the beam| I found some stones that are straight and pointed enough to pick at the soil.PPLast night I dreamt again that I was flying. Clouds sailed by| and I could smell the sharp tang of the sea.17,stone_pickaxe,Stone Pickaxe,stone,Masonry,pickup|copper_ore,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I smoothed out the pick and fit it on a handle earlier| and now I have a real tool for mining and exploring. The copper ore has seemed the loosest mineral| I will start with that first and follow the patterns I learned about stonework.18,stone_wedge,Stone Wedge,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,With a little bit of sanding| I have sharpened the edge of some stones into a wedge shape| and hollowed out a hole in the bottom for a handle.PPTroubling dreams again| this time I was surrounded by music of horns| while I watched from afar. I saw myself put out my fire| and after I went inside the tent| another fire appeared on the mountainside. I can't stop feeling alone.19,stone_axe,Stone Axe,stone,Masonry,pickup|wood|wool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,The slice of the wedge is enough to make a deep bite into trees| and with the handle| I can swing and gather wood faster than before.PPIt also might help me deal with the squirrels who keep eating my food. Or even help shear those sheep in the next valley over.20,thread,Thread,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Yesterday was quite a day. I managed to catch up to one of the wandering herds of sheep| and found them surprisingly tame. One of them ate out of my hand| and another one followed me home. I put the new axe to work| quickly shearing off some wool.PPWith a little work| I have managed to make it useable as some thread. My clothes are getting a bit thin after my travels| and I might be able to repair them now. Maybe even make new clothes eventually.21,felt,Felt,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Sometimes it pays off to experiment. Water and wool| never thought that was how felt was made. It's a bit misshapen right now| need to stretch and rework it a bit. Nothing ever turns out right the first time for me| but I keep trying.22,stone_hammer,Stone Hammer,stone,Masonry,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I was right! A little bit shaky| but the thread should hold the stone in place in my new hammer. I think it will be strong enough for some metalwork| if I can find enough copper to be productive.PPToday I made another venture toward the houses I saw earlier. Everything was so quiet| more like ruins than anything else. A thick carpet of moss covered the walls and floors.23,crate,Crate,wood,Woodworking,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I might survive after all. I'm feeling like my days are starting to settle down into a pattern. Wake up at dawn| heat up some food| and head out to explore. In the afternoon| I bring back everything I can| keeping it all in my rough camp. I cook another meal| and spend my evenings trying to make new things and writing in my journal.PPToday I built a crate| to help me organize all my supplies. It might prove more useful than that though| I've found it helps to be resourceful.24,boat,Boat,wood,Woodworking,vehicle,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I took a crate with me exploring today. And it rained. Again. While I hid under a small outcropping in the hills| my crate was caught up in a flash flood and was washed away. Sad to lose the crate| but it gave me an idea. This evening| I built another crate| twice as big| with a better bottom and sturdier frame. I think it might make a crude boat.25,barrel,Barrel,wood,Woodworking,pickup|water,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Barrel26,loom,Loom,wool,Tailoring,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,My second attempt at making a loom worked. The first one collapsed under the stress when I only used thread everywhere| but the copper wiring is proving much more stable.PPWarp| weft| weave| work. All I seem to do is more work| and I have to go further each time to find the resources I need. I should make something fun| something whimsical| something to kick me out of this monotony.27,glass,Glass,sand,Glassblowing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Another thing that turns out to be real| I left some sand on the furnace after another project| and when I came back| there was a puddle of glass. I always though the temperature needed to be higher. Maybe I'm not where I think I am| and if that's true| all bets are off as to what can happen.28,bottle,Bottle,sand,Glassblowing,pickup|water,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,A bottle| made by letting the glass cool on a circular rock| instead of the flat plates. Transportation and storage of water just became much easier.29,hourglass,Hourglass,sand,Glassblowing,refresh,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I never knew how much I missed keeping track of time. I've been making rough guesses based on the angle of the sun| but now I can measure out the hours.PPWhy do I need to know? I'm not missing any important appointments. Haha. I can be more precise in my smelting work| though| instead of having to peek in and see if something is finished| I can time it and then come back. Anything to help with the monotony.PPI just wish I knew when I was| and why there is no one else here.30,dust,Dust,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,That hammer has proven handy lately. Busting up a few odd-shaped and otherwise worthless rocks into dust might not be terribly useful| but it helps burn off some of my anger. Although I am now covered in fine powder and need to wash up and sand off.31,pulp,Pulp,wood,Scribing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Another use for the hammer. I can pound wood into a pulp when soaked it in water first| then smooth it and shape it however I want. Although it is still rather damp.PPThis journal is one of the few pieces of my old life I could keep| and it feels like I am close to making another on my own.32,paper,Paper,wood,Scribing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,A quick spot of drying on top of the furnace| and the thin sheets of pulp are now crude pieces of paper. Nothing yet like what I was used to| but they will work for now.,33,book,Book,wood,Scribing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Today I begin a new journal. Handmade paper| handmade ink from the local berries| and a twig are all I need. I'm amazed at everything I've been able to achieve| being here on my own.PPI still can't get over the weirdness of finding no other people here. I see their signs everywhere| in the abandoned orchard| the village full of empty houses and stores| and the domesticated animals. It's been a few months now| and I still don't know exactly where I am. I'm not sure if I ever will. This can't be the correct location she had in mind| but I'm going to make it work. It has to work.,34,mortar,Mortar,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Maybe this is how mortar is supposed to look| it seems more like gloopy paste than anything else right now. But I can't let it dry overnight or it will be useless for my next project.,35,brick,Brick,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,While working with my furnace today| I managed to shape some clay into useable bricks. I am still amazed at all the things it helps me build.PPI do worry about the heat leaking out through the rough stones| I'm thinking if I had used some bricks and something else| I could stoke it for a better blaze and do some intermediate metalwork.,36,wall,Wall,stone,Masonry,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,So that's how the others have built all those walls for their houses. I should have known it would take brick and mortar to get one started. Some large pieces of cloth should be enough for a roof and door| but it might get a bit dark inside.,37,brick_furnace,Brick Furnace,stone,Masonry,tool,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,"Putting this brick furnace together was no small feat. I've been working with stone| copper| water| wood| and clay| over and over again| just to learn enough to make this furnace.PPI really seems like no one is here. And therefore no one to read this journal. Ok| here's what I remember from that first day at work. It was advertised as a consulting position right in my home town| ""independent spirit| self-starter| no current attachements"" etc. I should have wondered more about the part at the end saying ""recommended interest in historical recreation.""PPAnyway| I go in| and find the most technologically advanced workplace I've ever seen. Robotic assistants for each worker| pneumatic tube elevators| breakfast| lunch and dinner all provided. The corporate motto was everywhere. ""See further. Look sharper. Fly higher.""  I'm introduced to Mino| she was the Chief Science Historian, andPPOh| wow| what is that noise?",38,window,Window,sand,Glassblowing,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,This frame is proving more useful than I thought. What better to frame than some glass for a window.PPI've been avoiding writing this down| but it is time for some honesty. I cut myself a few days ago with some of the first glass I made. It was touch and go for a while| I tore part of my shirt and wrapped up my finger. I really new some new clothes.,39,hat,Hat,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Hat,LOOK SHARP40,fabric,Fabric,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,I hate squirrels. Every time I think I've put aside enough food for the day| I come back and find I've been raided by the local squirrel population. But today I stayed at home| working through stringing up my new loom| and weaving my first pieces of fabric.PPI feel like a new phase of my life is beginning| and I'm making my dreams a reality. I think I'll create a new word for it: Cogmality| for how it feels like I am making a new reality.,41,sheet,Sheet,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,The weather has turned mild and the wind has picked up. Mildew is starting to build up in my tent| and after last night's unfortunate accident with the furnace (which I will not discuss) there are a few holes in the roof| and the recent rains are becoming harder to avoid.PPThis should be enough cloth for a few shirts if I put all the pieces together| but definitely not enough to fix the tent. That will have to wait.,42,canvas,Canvas,wool,Tailoring,none,0,1,1,99,0,0,0,Canvas,43,shirt,Shirt,wool,Tailoring,none,0,2,1,99,0,0,0,Shirt,LOOK SHARP44,store,House,stone,Masonry,store,0,2,1,99,0,0,0,All this time| and still alone except for the animals and wildnerness. But at night| I can hear the calling wolves.
